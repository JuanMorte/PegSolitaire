# Peg Solitaire
<p align = "justify"> Peg Solitaire is a Chinese-Checkers-style logic and strategy puzzle. In our game, the dots are pegs and the circles are empty holes. You are going to remove pegs by jumping over them, just like Checkers, until only one peg remains in the center of the board. And the destination(center), which is where the last peg should be, will be highlighted and shown on the right of the board. </p>
